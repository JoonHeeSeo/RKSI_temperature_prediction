# 🛰️ Incheon Airport (RKSI) Daily Temperature Prediction

## 📖 Overview

This project aims to forecast daily temperature at Incheon International Airport using AI-based time-series models.  
Unlike traditional physics-based Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), this project explores the potential of deep learning to improve prediction efficiency and accuracy.

The project also investigates the impact of diverse input variables on model performance through a series of experiments.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Programming**: Python, PyTorch
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- **Cloud Services**: AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda, Glue, etc.)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Experimentation**: Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Objectives

- Collect and preprocess temperature-related meteorological data for Incheon Airport
- Train LSTM-based models with various combinations of input features
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE)
- Design a scalable cloud-based architecture for real-time predictions using AWS services
