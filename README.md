# 🛰️ Incheon Airport (RKSI) Daily Temperature Prediction

[![Streamlit Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Demo-Streamlit-blue)](https://rksi-temperature-prediction.streamlit.app/)

https://rksi-temperature-prediction.streamlit.app/

## 📖 Overview

Predict **next‑day mean temperature** at **Incheon International Airport** (ICAO: **RKSI**) from historical weather observations using a suite of deep‑learning and classical models.

### Key Features

- **End‑to‑end pipeline**: data acquisition → preprocessing → model training → evaluation → interactive demo
- Multiple architectures: **Linear, MLP, LSTM, GRU, TCN, Transformer**
- Simple CLI interface for experimenting with individual or all models
- **Streamlit dashboard** for live inference, visualisations, and comparison with climatology baseline

## ⬇️ Data

Weather observations are pulled on‑demand from **[Meteostat](https://dev.meteostat.net/)** and cached locally.

```bash
python data/download_weather.py \
  --start 2023-01-01 \
  --end   2023-12-31 \
  --out   data/rksi_weather_2023.csv
```
